# Turtle core: native systems and change contracts

Source baseline: `mantech-turtle`, `b2d5a8549194f7ffa38e324dcb7a82ccc0ba2132`, reviewed 2026-09-05. This guide is a navigational and ownership reference, not a substitute for reading the current implementation. Line numbers below describe this baseline and will drift.

Start with the [compatibility audit](CORE_COMPATIBILITY_AUDIT_2026-09-05.md), [map coverage](core-audit/COVERAGE.md), and [diagnostic inventory](../doc/TURTLE_DIAGNOSTICS.md). `AGENTS.md` requires using native mechanisms and checking their full contract before making changes.

## How to investigate the next bug

1. Record the exact build, config, client version, entity entry/GUID, map/instance, reproduction and expected behavior. A local source tree is not proof of the running binary.
2. Find the public entry point: opcode, AI hook, spell effect, gossip/event script, DB loader or maintenance callback. Find its callers and the authoritative state it changes.
3. Identify the selected implementation, not just a filename. Check database binding, build inclusion, registration and native fallback. Check optional modules and runtime Lua separately.
4. Trace eligibility checks, caster/target roles, ownership, state transitions, notifications, persistence and failure cleanup. Identify which thread owns the object when each step runs.
5. Compare another working consumer of that same native API. Use CMaNGOS/upstream as references, not as proof of equivalent Turtle semantics.
6. Correct the demonstrated cause in the responsible layer. Do not put an isolated fix in an outer handler when the generic implementation already supports the behavior. Conversely, do not rewrite a shared spell effect to compensate for an invalid caller.
7. Test supported variants, rejected/repeated requests, transitions and persistence; include other consumers of any changed shared function. Record what was not exercised.
8. Update this guide, the finding ledger and regression tests when contracts change. Audit snapshots are evidence at a timestamp, not an evergreen content database.

Useful searches: `rg -n 'SymbolName' src modules tests`, literal `script_name` in the audit JSON, and `git diff <verified-base> -- <path>`. Do not search only dungeon folders: `generic_spell_ai` is registered in the game library.

## Execution and ownership map

Bot startup provisioning (`RandomPlayerbotFactory::CreateRandomBots`) must keep
account-creation futures separate from character-save futures. `get()` consumes
a future; waiting on it again throws `std::future_error`. Drain and clear both
bounded eight-task windows before advancing phases. Keep native `SaveToDB`,
cache registration with the session attached, and subsequent player/session
cleanup in that order. `BotCreationLifecycleTest` executes the production loops
with real futures and mock account/player services; it is not a realm startup
or database-persistence test.

| Boundary | Current source entry points | Contract to preserve |
| --- | --- | --- |
| World lifecycle | [World.cpp](../src/game/World.cpp), `World::Update` at 2731 | Global services, transports, session/result processing and map orchestration are separate phases. World-thread maintenance must not mutate a map concurrently with its owner. |
| Map jobs | [MapManager.cpp](../src/game/Maps/MapManager.cpp), `Update` at 336; [Map.cpp](../src/game/Maps/Map.cpp), `DoUpdate` at 1528 | Selected maps get joined owner jobs; transfers/unload occur across the ownership barriers. Serial/parallel choices are alternatives, not permission to execute both. |
| Object discovery and update | `Map::UpdateDiscoveredCells` at 802; [Creature.cpp](../src/game/Objects/Creature.cpp), `Update` at 716 | Discovery collects/deduplicates candidates; the owner runs native object logic. Players/cameras/corpses have separate handling. A second collector is not a second combat engine. |
| Completion and instance state | `Map::CompleteUpdate` at 1673 | Instances complete inside their update; continents use a later manager phase. Retain `UpdateScriptedEvents`, `ScriptsProcess`, optional Eluna, `i_data->Update`, weather and grid lifecycle. |
| Player and bot simulation | `Map::UpdatePlayers` at 1274, `UpdatePlayerAI` at 1396; [PlayerbotScripts.cpp](../modules/mod-playerbots/src/playerbot/PlayerbotScripts.cpp) | Core player state, module bookkeeping, individual AI and synthetic session work are distinct. The idle batch hands off the whole map's AI and waits; do not fan out mutating bots on one map independently. |
| Motion | [Unit.cpp](../src/game/Objects/Unit.cpp), [MotionMaster.cpp](../src/game/Movement/MotionMaster.cpp), `Map::UpdateActiveObjects`/motion work | Native motion and deferred `UpdateAsync` are distinct stages. Preserve queue-or-inline exclusivity, pending-set cleanup, map transitions and generator lifetime. |
| Packet ownership | [WorldSession.cpp](../src/game/WorldSession.cpp), `ProcessPackets` at 480; opcode registration/filter definitions | A handler must execute in the context its opcode permits. Extra queue-drain checkpoints must consume packets, not replay them. Synthetic bot packets retain handlers but intentionally have different socket admission. |
| Persistence | [Database sources](../src/shared/Database), native entity save methods | SQL worker execution and application of results are different ownership stages. Priority queues can reorder work across priorities; callbacks and object references must survive cancellation/shutdown safely. |
| Maintenance | [RandomPlayerbotMgr.cpp](../modules/mod-playerbots/src/playerbot/RandomPlayerbotMgr.cpp), auction module | Population counts include pending work; resumable plans need identity/generation checks. A cooperative budget cannot interrupt a single expensive operation. Preserve native final teleport/auction operations. |

There is no source evidence in these inspected paths of two complete simulation engines. That does **not** mean the architecture port is behavior-neutral, or that every shared-state race is excluded. See findings A1–A6 in the audit.

## Creature, boss and trash AI: actual selection

The important chain is:

`creature` spawn definition / dynamic summon → `creature_template` → `Creature::AIM_Initialize` → `FactorySelector::selectAI` → native `Creature::Update` → selected `AI()->UpdateAI` and lifecycle hooks.

- [CreatureAISelector.cpp](../src/game/AI/CreatureAISelector.cpp), `selectAI` at 37, asks the script manager first for eligible ordinary creatures/non-controlled pets. Possession, controlled pets, charm, totems and guards have special selection rules. Named AI, permit selection and fallback follow.
- [ScriptMgr.cpp](../src/game/ScriptMgr.cpp), `GetCreatureAI` at 1767, supports legacy registered scripts, typed script registries, global creature hooks and optional Eluna. An empty or stale `ai_name` alone does not establish which implementation actually runs.
- [ScriptLoader.cpp](../src/scripts/ScriptLoader.cpp) invokes `AddSC_*`; [scripts CMake](../src/scripts/CMakeLists.txt) and [game CMake](../src/game/CMakeLists.txt) determine source inclusion. File presence and successful compilation do not prove registration was invoked.
- [CreatureAI.cpp](../src/game/AI/CreatureAI.cpp) loads `creature_spells` through `SetSpellsList`; its spell-list update and cast helpers are native mechanisms. [CreatureEventAI.cpp](../src/game/AI/CreatureEventAI.cpp) separately loads `creature_ai_events` and can still run its spell list and melee with no event rows.
- `creature_ai_scripts` stores command scripts referenced by events; it is **not** the table of EventAI event rows. Mixing those schemas leads to incorrect audits and fixes.
- [GenericSpellAI.cpp](../src/game/AI/GenericSpellAI.cpp), registration at 154 and initialization at 390, derives generic behavior from template spell slots. Its presence outside `src/scripts` resolved 52 apparent missing bindings in the first scanner pass.
- [ScriptedAI](../src/game/AI/ScriptedAI.h) and [ScriptedInstance](../src/game/AI/ScriptedInstance.h) provide native combat/instance helpers. Reuse those instead of separate hand-built targeting, spell, door or respawn systems.

### Architecture implications for every encounter

[BackgroundWorldScheduling.h](../src/shared/BackgroundWorldScheduling.h) returns no distant-creature interval for non-continents. `DescribeBackgroundCreature` in `Map.cpp:770` additionally protects script IDs, non-ordinary selected AI types, zone scripts, world-boss rank, escorts, controlled units, combat, relevant auras/events/casting, active objects and transport passengers.

Therefore dungeon/raid actors are outside this particular continent-only throttle. They still depend on shared discovery, map ownership, movement/protocol, spell clocks, DB callbacks and visibility. World-boss protection applies to the boss once selected; nearby helpers, trigger objects, grid activation and custom global hooks still need tracing. Do not interpret the guard as proof that every encounter dependency is protected.

No special conversion is required in each boss file to use the new map scheduling: it runs underneath the native AI. Conversely, adding an extra boss-update loop to "enable the new tech" would risk duplicate mechanics.

## Instances, doors, summons and persistence

- `map_template.script_name` selects the instance implementation. [InstanceData](../src/game/Maps/InstanceData.h) defines lifecycle hooks; [ScriptedInstance.cpp](../src/game/AI/ScriptedInstance.cpp) implements helpers including `DoUseDoorOrButton` at 11.
- Trace `OnCreatureCreate`/`OnObjectCreate`, stored GUIDs, `SetData`/`GetData`/`GetData64`, encounter states, reset/evade/death, save/load and world-object recreation. Correctly opening a door once is insufficient if it remains closed after reload or opens on a failed encounter.
- Default examples: [Blackwing Lair instance](../src/scripts/dungeons/blackwing_lair/instance_blackwing_lair.cpp), [Deadmines instance](../src/scripts/dungeons/deadmines/instance_deadmines.cpp). Custom examples: [Lower Karazhan](../src/scripts/dungeons/lower_karazhan_halls/instance_lower_karazhan_halls.cpp) registers multiple trash AIs as well as the instance; [Solnius](../src/scripts/dungeons/emerald_sanctum/boss_solnius.cpp) connects gossip, instance lookup and boss behavior.
- Summoned bosses/adds may have no ordinary spawn row. Search creature entry constants, summon spells, `SummonCreature`, event commands and summon callbacks. Check cleanup on wipe, phase transitions and grid/map unload.
- Blank `map_template.script_name` is not automatically a bug: some content relies on creature/GO/EventAI/native mechanisms. Identify the intended state owner before adding an instance controller.
- Portals may be visual gameobjects plus separate area-trigger/teleport data. A missing visual object's script binding warrants investigation, not an automatic extra teleport handler.

## Other native entry points and change boundaries

This is a navigation index. The targeted audit did not execute every behavior in the following systems.

| System | Start here | Related consumers / checks before changing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Casts, melee, damage and death | [SpellHandler.cpp](../src/game/Handlers/SpellHandler.cpp) `HandleCastSpellOpcode:325`; [Spell.cpp](../src/game/Spells/Spell.cpp) `prepare:3507`, `cast:3775`, `CheckCast:5561`; [Unit.cpp](../src/game/Objects/Unit.cpp) `DealDamage:756`, `Kill:1190` | Players, creatures, pets, triggered spells, threat, immunity, procs, auras, rewards and script hooks share these paths. A scheduler must not replay elapsed time as duplicate effects. |
| Spell effects and auras | [SpellEffects.cpp](../src/game/Spells/SpellEffects.cpp), [SpellAuras.cpp](../src/game/Spells/SpellAuras.cpp), [UnitAuraProcHandler.cpp](../src/game/UnitAuraProcHandler.cpp) | Dispatch by actual effect/type. Preserve caster vs target, trigger flags, resources, duration, death/removal and proc ordering. |
| Trainers | [NPCHandler.cpp](../src/game/Handlers/NPCHandler.cpp) `HandleTrainerBuySpellOpcode:285`; [Player.cpp](../src/game/Objects/Player.cpp) `LearnSpell:4670`, `HasSpell:5383`; spell effects 2254/3152 | Player training and pet training are different supported services. The pet path requires a player caster, native eligibility/training-point checks, pet persistence and owner notification. Verify successful learning before payment; failure must not later finish as a free delayed purchase. |
| Loot and inventory | [LootMgr.cpp](../src/game/LootMgr.cpp) `LootTemplate::Process:1324`; [LootHandler.cpp](../src/game/Handlers/LootHandler.cpp) `HandleAutostoreLootItemOpcode:41`; `Player::SendLoot:9451` | Template/reference/group/condition selection is separate from allowed-player checks and inventory storage. Include group distribution, quest loot, pickpocket/skinning, full bags, release/retry and persistence. Do not replace the native eligibility/store sequence. |

Player-specific quest loot is not contained in `Loot::items`. Turtle appends the
eligible player's `m_playerQuestItems` after the shared slots in `LootView`.
Adapters must enumerate `GetMaxSlotInLootFor(playerGuid)` and resolve each slot
through `LootItemInSlot(slot, playerGuid, ...)`; direct indexing of the shared
vector silently omits quest items. Creature eligibility should use
`Player::IsAllowedToLoot`, and the native autostore handler remains authoritative
for storage, quest counters, notifications and failure handling.
| Quests, rewards and XP | [QuestHandler.cpp](../src/game/Handlers/QuestHandler.cpp) `HandleQuestgiverCompleteQuest:588`; `Player::RewardQuest:15269`; [QuestDef.cpp](../src/game/QuestDef.cpp) | Acceptance, objectives, item/money requirements, repeatability, reputation, XP rate modifiers, reward scripts and persistence. A quest relation alone is not proof that objectives work. |
| Trade | [TradeHandler.cpp](../src/game/Handlers/TradeHandler.cpp) `HandleAcceptTradeOpcode:293` | Both accept states, item ownership, bag space, enchant spell targets, money, cancellation and saves. Native code saves both players; that alone is not proof of one cross-player atomic transaction. |
| Chat, WHO and commands | [ChatHandler.cpp](../src/game/Handlers/ChatHandler.cpp) `HandleMessagechatOpcode:176`; [MiscHandler.cpp](../src/game/Handlers/MiscHandler.cpp) `HandleWhoOpcode:271`; [Chat sources](../src/game/Chat) | Client request parsing, filters, result counts/wire fields, security levels, channel membership and visibility. Do not special-case one displayed name or confuse account authority with character level. |
| Travel | [TaxiHandler.cpp](../src/game/Handlers/TaxiHandler.cpp) `HandleActivateTaxiOpcode:203`; [MotionMaster.cpp](../src/game/Movement/MotionMaster.cpp); [TransportMgr.cpp](../src/game/Transports/TransportMgr.cpp) `Update:538`; `Player::TeleportTo:2670` | Taxi flight is not moving-transport simulation. Preserve route data, client/server templates, embark/disembark offsets, transfer ACKs, native relocation, visibility and generator lifetime. Client WDB cache and server DBC/data are distinct. |
| Gameobjects and interaction | [GameObject.cpp](../src/game/Objects/GameObject.cpp) `Use:1477`; ScriptMgr gossip/GO hooks | GO type determines native behavior. Check door/button state, spell activation, use conditions, area triggers, event callbacks and cooldowns before attaching a new script. |
| PvP/group systems | [Battleground sources](../src/game/Battlegrounds), [OutdoorPvP sources](../src/game/OutdoorPvP), [Group.cpp](../src/game/Group/Group.cpp), [ThreatManager.cpp](../src/game/Threat/ThreatManager.cpp) | Team/faction and controlled-unit rules, match lifecycle, objective scripts, group state and threat ownership. PvP is not certified by a PvE test. |

### Trainer lesson to retain

Knowing that a service touches `SPELL_EFFECT_LEARN_SPELL` is only the start. The sibling `SPELL_EFFECT_LEARN_PET_SPELL` uses different state and side effects. The original direct player-learning approach did not cover it. At this baseline the handler reuses the native pet spell path, and a handler regression test covers success/failure/repeat variants. The test uses mocks and does not prove the entire live spell engine. Future changes must inspect sibling effect types and other callers before narrowing a generic service.

## Evidence maintenance

- September 6 bot dispatch: `MovementAction::DispatchMovement` must choose one
  native movement path. Direct/free-flying/single-point requests use MovePoint;
  generated multi-point requests use MovePath after hazard avoidance, with no
  stale point generator underneath. Preserve the first route vertex when
  MoveSplineInit replaces vertex zero with the live position, and pass walking
  mode through Turtle's explicit walk argument. Empty requests do not interrupt
  existing motion. BotMovementDispatchTest executes the real dispatcher,
  MovePath and point initialize/update bodies with deterministic unit/spline
  services. It covers double launches, options, walking, short/empty paths,
  hazard-point retention and point speed reinitialization, not full live trips.

- [Bot technology integration](BOT_TECH_INTEGRATION_2026-09-05.md) adapts the
  CMaNGOS bounded retry engine after native eligibility, excluding combat and
  human-directed activity. Do not move retry admission ahead of prerequisites.
  The shared bot UseTaxi helper validates both Turtle endpoints and discovers
  an unknown source only through a matching interactable flight master; it
  never bypasses native anticheat. MinimalMove must retain failed flight legs.
  Dungeon/avoid-list behavior uses the existing strategy/trigger/action/value
  registries and the existing MoveAwayFromCreature path implementation.
  RPG crowd selection tallies eligible nearby bot targets once per selection;
  do not restore the old >=200-neighbor exemption or per-candidate scan.
  MoveToRpgTargetAction consumes the corrected nav coordinates, rejects stale/
  unreachable targets through native values, and only pauses creature patrols.
  ClosestCorrectPoint must preserve its input on query failure (also used by
  corpse recovery). BotRpgMovementTest covers these native boundary fragments.
  The temporary BehaviorTrace hook reads owner-local state and uses the existing
  core performance log with bounded, rotating GUID samples. It must never run
  target-selection triggers, change masters or enable global verbose logging.
  Controls, limits and removal sites are in TURTLE_DIAGNOSTICS.md.
  A Unit owns a MoveSpline before its first path is initialized: check native
  `Initialized()` before reading Duration()/length-dependent data. Trace callers
  must handle absent/fresh/cleared paths without changing the movement API's
  contract. BotTraceSnapshotTest covers the full enabled snapshot body with
  checked spline storage; limiter-only tests cannot establish snapshot safety.
  The September 6 taxi-specific extension reports requested path/from/to and
  probes the nearest flagged flight master within 20 yards only after trace
  admission. It visits both native object containers, including unavailable
  NPCs, without loading grids, and asks CanInteractWithNPC for its optional
  rejection explanation. The predicate's original checks, order and bool
  result remain unchanged; the probe never supplies a new NPC or changes
  eligibility for gameplay. An activation logs route IDs without probing its
  post-taxi state. NpcInteractionTraceTest exercises the native predicate and
  formatter with deterministic map/DBC/reputation services, not a live flight.

- Selected fork adaptations are recorded in
  [SELECTED_FORK_INTEGRATION_2026-09-05.md](SELECTED_FORK_INTEGRATION_2026-09-05.md).
  Null-owner PathInfo calls return NOPATH, not partial paths; native AB discovery
  retains range/eligibility/capture checks; bot broadcasts honor their global gate.
  PetIsDeadValue caches only its database fallback per value instance, not live
  pet state, and Reset/live-pet observations invalidate that fallback. Do not
  replace this with a global cache or a blanket slow cadence for pet reactions.
  ForkIntegrationTest exercises these boundary fragments, not a live realm.

- Native bot travel searches own `std::async` futures. Resetting/replacing an
  unfinished future can join the worker and block the map owner. Full reset
  expires the travel target, retaining unfinished ownership; all three request
  variants reject replacement until ready. Only PREPARE results are eligible
  for adoption. `GetPartitions` releases its existing five-worker permit on
  exception as well as success. Do not detach workers, skip map joins or add a
  second travel engine. `TravelFutureLifecycleTest` covers the native fragments;
  bot destruction still joins outstanding work and is not a bounded cancellation.

- The playerbot node graph persists links, point geometry and derived costs in
  `ai_playerbot_travelnode*`. Runtime loading now recomputes walk distance and
  water exposure from those stored points while retaining creature-risk data,
  and restores the original/upstream 3,600-divisor taxi route preference. This
  avoids a destructive graph/account reset when derived costs are stale. A*
  retains one native graph and applies a stable, bounded per-party preference
  to comparable edges so large populations do not all select one corridor.
  Destination/point ordering is also seeded by party, purpose and coarse
  position rather than wall-clock timing. Short water crossings retain native
  swim timing; sustained swims receive a bounded safety cost so roads, taxis
  and transports win when available without making a required swim impossible.
  `TravelRoutePolicyTest` covers time units, determinism and the preference
  bound; live validation still requires observing route distribution, taxi
  completion and ordinary player travel at the configured population.

- September 6 flight-ID contract: persisted `flightPath` objects are identifiers
  in the currently loaded native TaxiPath DBC, not stable across client/data
  layouts. The compat `sTaxiNodesStore` reads ObjectMgr's DB-backed taxi nodes;
  `sTaxiPathStore` and path geometry come from `DataDir/dbc`. The SQL `taxipath`
  mirror can be empty and is not the runtime authority. On a complete cached
  graph, `generateAll()` now calls the existing `generateTaxiPaths()` before
  coverage warming. Partial/full generation already calls it and must not call
  it twice. Refresh both IDs and geometry through `setPathTo`, retaining native
  cost/eligibility rules. Do not dirty `hasToSave` solely for this startup pass,
  rewrite all cached geometry in SQL, reset bots, or bypass NPC source checks.
  Native point arrays can contain null holes: generation skips incomplete data
  with a startup count. It does not remove arbitrary cached/custom links when
  native data is missing. `BotTaxiCacheRefreshTest` executes these production
  boundaries; see the bot integration ledger for the all-270 live-data audit.

- Custom aura types 227–230 are native non-immediate modifiers. Registration
  must cover both `AuraHandler` and `AuraProcHandler` and the `TOTAL_AURAS`
  bound. Actual arithmetic belongs in rage, skill cast time, periodic damage
  done and chain damage taken, using existing aura lists/multiplier helpers.
  Do not substitute attacker spell-ID checks for recipient damage reductions.
  Tests: `NativeCustomAuraTest`; exact affected data and limits: audit ledger.

- The [audit correction ledger](AUDIT_FIXES_2026-09-05.md) supersedes resolved
  baseline findings. In particular, use the live native spell map rather than
  adding another capability cache, retain AI elapsed time across admission
  deferrals, and never write item progress into packed creature/GO quest slots.
- Turtle's `quest_cast_objective` defines player-target spell objectives.
  `World::SetInitialWorldSettings` loads those after quests/player cache;
  `ObjectMgr::LoadQuestSpellCastObjectives` deliberately creates synthetic
  objective IDs. A missing creature-template join is not sufficient evidence
  of a broken objective for these quests.

- [audit-core-contracts.ps1](../tools/audit-core-contracts.ps1) regenerates lexical source indexes and content joins. Without `-RefreshDatabase` it only reads the saved snapshot. Explicit refresh takes the existing local query adapter and issues read-only SELECTs against `tw_world`; it requires network access and valid credentials outside the report.
- The script is an investigator's helper, not a C++ parser. It does not resolve preprocessor branches, dynamic registration, runtime Lua, all summon dependencies, expected encounter design, or live availability. CMake hints for modules/shared are unknown rather than assumed enabled.
- The snapshot contains NPC/content information, not player accounts, characters or credentials. DB reads were sequential, not a consistent-transaction snapshot.
- Existing architecture tests are under [tests/architecture](../tests/architecture). `ContentHookContract.cmake` checks source wiring by lexical/regex assertions; passing it does not establish exactly-once execution or all boss mechanics.
- Diagnostic controls/removal belong in the existing [diagnostic inventory](../doc/TURTLE_DIAGNOSTICS.md), not scattered permanent logs. Disabled summary logging does not necessarily remove timers/atomics.
- Record source revision and fresh evidence on every significant update. Repository documentation makes the knowledge reusable; it does not make an assistant infallible or remove the need to reopen current source.
